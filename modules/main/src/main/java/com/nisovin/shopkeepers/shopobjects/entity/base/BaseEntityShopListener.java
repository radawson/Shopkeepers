	// We want to bypass other plugins by default, so that shops can also be opened in protected
	// regions.
	// We cancel the event to prevent any vanilla mechanics from taking place, and also to indicate
	// to other plugins, and to later event handlers of our own plugin, that they can safely ignore
	// the event (e.g. to prevent protection plugins from sending their 'interaction denied' message
	// for shopkeeper entities). For that purpose, we handle and cancel the event as early as
	// possible (LOWEST priority).
	// Using a higher event priority with a setting to ignore whether the event got already
	// cancelled by other plugins is not an option, because then these other plugins will already
	// have handled the event and we have no chance to avoid their side effects (e.g. protection
	// plugins will already have sent the player their 'interaction denied' message, even though we
	// open the shop UI afterwards anyway).
	// In some usecases it may be desired by the server admin that we take into account whether some
	// other plugin wants to cancel the interaction. For those situations the setting
	// 'check-shop-interaction-result' can be used to call an additional interaction event that
	// other plugins can react to and which determines whether we handle the interaction. Since this
	// might cause side effects in general due to other plugins handling the event, this is disabled
	// by default. This also requires that we listen to and cancel the event as early as possible,
	// so that the event is not handled twice by other plugins in this situation.
	// There is still the potential for conflicts with other event handlers that run on LOWEST
	// priority as well. If these are event handlers of our own plugin (for which we control the
	// order in which they are registered and handle the event), we usually want to ignore the event
	// if it has already been cancelled, because this indicates that the event has triggered some
	// other mechanic that takes precedence.
	// And if the event has been cancelled by another plugin, we cannot differentiate between
	// whether this is one of the cases that we could relatively safely bypass (for example, if some
	// protection plugin reacts on LOWEST event priority and has sent its 'interaction denied'
	// message, it may be reasonable to still open the shop menu regardless to at least remain
	// functional in that case), or if this is a case in which we definitively do not want to
	// trigger our action (for example, if another plugin defines a mechanic that is triggered by
	// the same event we usually want that only one of these actions takes place).
	// For the above reasons we therefore ignore the event if it has already been cancelled.
	// One option to resolve these conflicts with other plugins that listen on LOWEST event priority
	// as well might seem to be the 'loadbefore' entry in the plugin.yml file. However, this is not
	// an acceptable solution, because it depends on being aware of and explicitly specifying these
	// other plugins, and it breaks whenever the Shopkeepers plugin is dynamically reloaded, because
	// that re-registers all event handlers and thereby moves them to the back of the registered
	// event handlers.
	// In an attempt to resolve these conflicts with other plugins anyway (for instance,
	// GriefPrevention, a popular protection plugin, reacts on LOWEST event priority), we forcefully
	// move our event handler(s) to the front of the relevant handler list. This ensures that our
	// event handler(s) are executed first, even if our plugin has been dynamically reloaded.
	// If another plugin is supposed to still execute before us so that it can cancel our event
	// handling, it could either apply a similar trick, or the server admin can enable the already
	// mentioned 'check-shop-interaction-result' setting.
	// The reasoning outlined here does not only apply to this specific event handler, but also to
	// other event handlers in this plugin for which we chose to execute at event priority LOWEST.
